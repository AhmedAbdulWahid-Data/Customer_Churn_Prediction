# **🚀 Churn Prediction Model - The Ultimate Battle of Algorithms ⚔️**

Welcome to the **Churn Prediction Model** project! 🎉 Here, I've created a machine learning powerhouse by implementing churn prediction in **3 epic ways**: using **Scikit-Learn**, **PySpark**, and **PyTorch**. Whether you're into traditional machine learning, distributed computing, or deep learning wizardry, we've got you covered. 🔥

The goal? To predict customer churn **(aka whether a customer will stick around or bounce)** and save businesses from losing their most valuable customers. 💡

# 🌟 What’s Inside? 🤔

This repo takes a deep dive into customer churn prediction using three methods:

1. **Scikit-Learn**: The classic workhorse of machine learning, featuring **Decision Trees**, **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** for model training. 🌳🐾
2. **PySpark**: Supercharge your models with the power of distributed computing! Here we use **Logistic Regression** for churn prediction at scale. ⚡
3. **PyTorch**: Because deep learning isn’t just a buzzword – we build a **Neural Network** for churn prediction like a pro. 🤖💥


## 🚀 Why You Should Care

If you're a business owner or data scientist, predicting churn is a game-changer! Know who’s at risk of leaving, and target your efforts to save them. The models built in this repo help businesses gain insights into their customers and boost retention. 🙌
